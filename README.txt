 I study triple negative breast cancer. I'm working on a drug combination to target a 
transcription factor called STAT3 in TNBC and understand the underlying signal transduction 
pathways invovled in the treatment.

My name is Ciana Lazu. I am a MS Genetics student and my research interests are host-microbe interactions, plant pathology, and microbiomes!
